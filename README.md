DMPageControl
=============

An high customizable alternative to UIPageControl.

DMPageControl redefines exactly every property and methods available in standard UIKit's UIPageControl.
However you can customize it by setting additional properties as like dots diameter, on/off colors, element's spacing and style.

Finally you can also use custom UIImages as image for each state of the dot (take a look at the screenshot behind).

It's based upon an original work of Damien DeVille with DDPageControl at http://ddeville.me.
